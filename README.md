# Speedometer
 A simple speedometer I made using React-Native. It was a super quick POC, so that's why all the code is in App.js
 
 
 <h2>Features</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Uses your geolocation to calculate your current speed</li>
 <li>Retrieves speed limit info. from HERE API</li>
 <li>Side by side comparison of your speed and the speed limit</li>
 <li>(Relatively) clean, nice looking UI</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>Made possible by:</h2>
<ul>
 <li>HERE API</li>
 <li>react-native-geolocation</li>
</ul>
